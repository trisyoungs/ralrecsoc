Instructions on how to join the RAL RecSoc are given below.  If you have any questions about the membership categories or eligibility, please email [RALRecSocMemSec@stfc.ac.uk](mailto:RALRecSocMemSec@stfc.ac.uk).

# Full / Affiliate Membership (via CSSC)
### Available to all employees of STFC (including contractors and students) and affiliated institutions

Our standard membership is via the [Civil Service Sports Council](https://www.cssc.co.uk/) (CSSC) which entitles you to a huge range of discounts and benefits, as well as access to the RAL RecSoc and all of its clubs and facilities. This is the standard mechanism for joining the RAL RecSoc and is available to all STFC employees as well as our affiliate institutions - Diamond and the ESA. CSSC membership is **£4.50 / month**, paid by Direct Debit.

#### 1) Go to the [CSSC website](https://www.cssc.co.uk/) and complete the [joining form](https://www.cssc.co.uk/join).

#### 2) Once you receive confirmation of your membership from the CSSC, along with your membership number, please forward your confirmation email to the membership secretary at [RALRecSocMemSec@stfc.ac.uk](mailto:RALRecSocMemSec@stfc.ac.uk), making sure to state your CSSC membership number.

#### 3) Your details will then be added to our database and mailing list, and a confirmation of this will be sent by return email, at which point you are officially a RAL RecSoc member.

# Associate Membership
### Available to staff from other institutions and companies on the Campus

The alternative mechanism for joining the RAL RecSoc is as an "Associated" member - this does not involve membership to the [CSSC](https://www.cssc.co.uk/) as it is either unavailable to you (since you are not employed by STFC or one of the affiliated bodies) or is not suitable (i.e. you are are only a short-term visitor to the Campus). As such it comes with none of the associated benefits of CSSC membership, and provides access to the RAL RecSoc and its clubs and activities only. Associate membership costs **£5 / month**, paid in advance for the membership year which runs from September 1st to August 31st.

#### 1) Fill in the [associate membership form](/forms/RAL_RecSoc_Associate_Membership-2022.docx) and email it to [RALRecSocMemSec@stfc.ac.uk](mailto:RALRecSocMemSec@stfc.ac.uk).

#### 2) The RAL RecSoc membership secretary will then contact you for payment.

#### 3) Once payment is received your details will then be added to our records and mailing list, and a confirmation of this will be sent by return email, at which point you are officially a RAL RecSoc member.

#### 4) If you do not have a suitable site pass (e.g. as an STFC short-term employee) then we will request some additional required details from you and forward those on to the RAL Site Pass office (RAL building R75, main reception).  You will then need to visit the site pass office to have your photograph taken and collect your photo ID.  This is essential in order to gain access to the RAL RecSoc compound, which requires an electronic pass to access.
