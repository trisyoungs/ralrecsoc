The RAL Badminton Club provides a regular session for those interested in badminton to be able to play both socially and competitively. Sessions are held at the [Abingdon White Horse Leisure Centre](https://www.better.org.uk/leisure-centre/vale-of-white-horse/white-horse-leisure-and-tennis-centre) on Wednesdays from 17:30 to 19:30.

Badminton Club membership is open to all RecSoc members and all standards are welcome, from complete beginners to advanced players. Members are allowed to show up for any session during each month of membership but are not expected to play for the full 2-hour session.

Individuals will need to bring their own racquet (recommendations can be provided). There will be a limited number of spares for newer members to try, however regular members will be expected to bring their own. Shuttles will be provided.
