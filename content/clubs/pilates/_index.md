Pilates classes are held by our instructor Leanne Parry who teaches Stott Pilates, which is a contemporary style that aims at restoring the natural curvatures of the spine and rebalancing the muscles surrounding the joints. 

Stott Pilates is suitable for young and old, male and female. It can help athletes who want to improve their core stability to keep them in peak condition, people returning to exercise after a break, or those who just want to maintain and improve their general flexibility and mobility.
