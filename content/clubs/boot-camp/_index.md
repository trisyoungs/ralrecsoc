Lunchtime Bootcamp classes with our intructor Colin Berryman, who has been in the health & fitness industry for 22 years supporting and motivating people to achieve their personal goals, run three times a week on Monday, Wednesday and Friday lunchtimes. The outdoor circuits classes are suitable for men and women and consist of a variety of excercises and activities that target all-round fitness, strength and stamina. They can help you lose weight, tone and shape your body and increase cardiovascular fitness. 

During summer months boot camp is held on the Sports Field behind R58, while during winter (or less clement summers) training moves to the hard tennis courts, also behind R58.
