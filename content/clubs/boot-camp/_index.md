Our boot camp offers you a chance to challenge yourself with outdoor weights and circuit training. Our instructor Colin has many years of experience teaching this kind of class, and is sure to give you a good workout!

During summer months boot camp is held on the Sports Field behind R58, while during winter (or less clement summers) training moves to the hard tennis courts, also behind R58.
