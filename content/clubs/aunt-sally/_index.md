Aunt Sally is a popular, fun and sociable [Oxfordshire pub game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aunt_Sally) that involves 2 teams taking turns throwing wooden batons at a wooden skittle known as a "doll" or "dolly".
 
The RecSoc Aunt Sally team play in the local [Abingdon & District ASA Summer League](https://abingdonauntsally.com/) and are looking for new players. Home matches are played at the RecSoc and away games are played at pubs and social clubs in local towns and villages. The RecSoc Aunt Sally "pitch" and equipment are available for lunchtime use so anyone can have a go for fun or take on their colleagues for some friendly competition.
