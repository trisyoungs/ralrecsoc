  description:  Club members store their own instruments/equipment in the Music Room, and as a common courtesy you should seek the permission of the owner before using their gear. Please get in touch with the club chair if you want to locate the owner of a particular piece of equipment. Equally, if you want to leave a piece of your gear in the room long-term then you must get in touch with the club secretary to let them know it's there, as well as its value, otherwise it will not be covered by our insurance.

The RAL Music Club provides facilities, equipment and instruments for its members to use. Membership costs Â£1/month and you must be a member of the Music Club in order to use the music room or borrow any of the instruments or gear. Membership entitles you to use the music room in R58 for practice or lessons at any time during the week or weekend.

Members of the club use the facilities for a variety of purposes ranging from solo or private practice through to taking lessons or playing with a full band. If you're interested in finding other people to play / jam with, let us know and we can try to hook you up.

The club periodically holds live music/open mic nights in the RecSoc lounge where club members can perform to other music club members and campus staff alike, and the RecSoc occasionally arranges larger events which club members can perform at.
