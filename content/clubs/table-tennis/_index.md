The Table Tennis Club is a small, friendly club, and is keen to attract new members. All standards are welcome from complete beginners through to advanced players.

Club facilities are available at lunchtime to all RecSoc members who wish to play table tennis informally. The Club also enters teams into the local Didcot and Oxford leagues. The evening league games can have a more competitive edge, yet also have a friendly and sociable side. The season runs from September until April.

Playing table tennis is a fun and sociable sport, and is excellent for improving general fitness, core muscle strength, dynamic balance and hand-eye coordination, so why not come along and join in.
