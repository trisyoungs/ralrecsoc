Yoga classes are held by our instructor Diana Reynolds, a qualified British Wheel of Yoga teacher who has been practicing yoga for over 15 years. The classes are designed to help improve strength and flexibility and to benefit from learning breathing and meditation techniques to give a fulfilling and relaxing experience. 

Yoga is an ancient tradition for a modern world. Yoga gives us a sense of well-being so we are ready to face life's challenges. Sometimes the stresses of modern living affect our sense of inner peace and moving mindfully in yoga helps us to relax and open up the body so we feel both calm and energised.
