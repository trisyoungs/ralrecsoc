Netball sessions are held on the RAL RecSoc tennis courts one lunchtime a week, with sessions involving an element of training as well as friendly informal games.  We welcome all abilities, even if you haven't played since leaving school
and, suffice to say, running around and throwing a ball is great fun and a really good way to get some fresh air and exercise during your lunchbreak.
