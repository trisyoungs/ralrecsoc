The Photography Club at RAL meet once a month, in one of the RAL conference rooms, to show and to discuss photographs. The club occasionally organises photographic walks around the RAL site.  Only paid-up members are entitled to show photographs, but anyone may attend the meetings and join in the discussions. All aspects of photography are considered, including techniques, equipment, and aesthetics. A different theme is chosen for each of the monthly meetings.
