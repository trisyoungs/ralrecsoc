Located in R58, our on-site gym has been recently modernised and its floor space extended. At present the equipment comprises free weights only, but over the next few months we are due to receive a significant new suite of machines and stations to make the room a real multi-use space. Membership is Â£5/month, payable in advance for the calendar year.
