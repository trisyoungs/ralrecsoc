Meeting fortnightly in the R58 Lounge, the Arts & Crafts club is an inclusive environment where you can come along to draw, sketch, paint, or create with the other members over lunch. We provide members with a chance to come along and try a range of different creative activities, or use it as communal workspace for their own arty projects. Art supplies are provided or you can bring your own.

The Club will also offer members, and other creatives around the RecSoc, the opportunity to display their artwork in the Lounge - though there is no pressure to exhibit, should you just like to use the sessions as an opportunity to have a break from the work day and be creative.
