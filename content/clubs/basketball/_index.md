The RAL Basketball Club is open to all abilities. We play outdoors on the tennis courts behind the RAL Rec Soc when weather allows, usually at lunchtimes during the week in the summer. We also book indoor courts nearby (Didcot) during the winter. Please send us an email if you would like to join the mailing list, which we use to arrange sessions. If there is enough interest, we can run beginners sessions - please get in touch!
