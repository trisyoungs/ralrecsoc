The RAL Fencing Club is a small friendly club that welcomes complete beginners and experienced fencers alike. Our instructor, Austen Rose, has been coaching for many years and holds British Academy of Fencing level 3 awards at foil, epee and sabre.

Modern fencing combines athleticism and mental agility in an exciting blend of speed, agility, and tactics. It's an extremely safe sport, is very well regulated in terms of the protective gear you have to wear, and we have all the equipment you?ll need to participate.
