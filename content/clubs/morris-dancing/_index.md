Lepton Morris meet weekly on Thursdays from 16:30 to 17:30 in the RecSoc Sports Hall.  We have a number of regular members from RAL and others who join us as associate members of the RecSoc.  

We dance a variety of Morris styles including, Cotswold, Border, Molly and Clog.  You can recognise us by the Lab Coats in which we dance and you don't need to have had experience of Morris Dancing to join Lepton Morris - beginners are very welcome!
