The tennis club is free to join and provides rackets and balls to any members who want to play. The club offers casual play and coaching sessions and there are also organised competitions for those that prefer more competitive match play. The courts can be booked for confirmed lunchtime sessions or they can be used casually by members outside of lunchtimes, evenings and weekends

Tennis is very popular and the club has lots of members so it proves a great place to get fit, learn a new sport and make new friends along the way.
