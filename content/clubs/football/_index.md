The Football Club provides facilities and equipment for lunchtime and evening games. Football at RAL is open to men and women of all ages and ability. There are games or training sessions on the RAL sports field on Tuesday or Thursday lunchtimes, depending on player availability and the weather. 

There are also occasional 11-a-side matches between various RAL Departments or Divisions teams, as well as testimonial matches for people retiring or leaving RAL. In addition to informal lunchtime games there are five different RAL and Diamond based teams that play in the Harwell 6-a-side Football League which runs from September to April each season.
