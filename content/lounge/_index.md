The recently-refurbished lounge offers a welcoming space to hang out in with your colleagues, or to use for quiet meeting. Our fully-licensed bar is open most lunchtimes for the sale for snacks, soft drinks, hot drinks, and alcoholic beverages, and we have a relatively large outdoor green space with picnic tables for your use.

The Lounge is used by some clubs as a working space during some lunchtimes, but don't be shy - come and see what they're up to!
